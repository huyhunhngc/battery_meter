# Welcome to Battery Meter

The aim of this app is to provide an appwidget that shows the battery level of the main device. It
uses Glance and a couple of other Jetpack libraries.

For now the main goal is not to offer it on Google Play, but to use it as a tool for finding out how
easy / still possible it is to write appwidgets that are updated frequently enough to be useful.

I will be documenting some of my learnings in this README.
