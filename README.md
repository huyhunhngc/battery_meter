# Battery Meter & Widget App

This Android application provides a battery level meter and a customizable widget, utilizing Jetpack Compose for the UI and Glance for the widget implementation. The app efficiently monitors battery levels and displays the current status both in-app and on the home screen widget.

## Features
- Real-time Battery Monitoring: The app displays the current battery level with a dynamic UI.
- Home Screen Widget: Add a widget to your home screen for easy access to your battery level.
  
The aim of this app is to provide an appwidget that shows the battery level of the main device. It
uses Glance and a couple of other Jetpack libraries.

For now the main goal is not to offer it on Google Play, but to use it as a tool for finding out how
easy / still possible it is to write appwidgets that are updated frequently enough to be useful.
